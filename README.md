# WebLearn

This project is a proof-of-concept online learning platform.
It features locally-stored encrypted logins (using SQLite and passport.js) and a custom solution for automated test correction.

The codebase has been written to easily allow subject expansion in the future, with the aim of implementing a Teacher GUI which would allow instructors to add/create content as they need.

This project was an exercise in building a React/Node based full-stack app, and is currently in a functional prototype stage.
